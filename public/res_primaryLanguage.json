      "description": "Hello, there üñê I am from South Korea. I took Cybercrime and Cyber Investigation classes in graduate school and found the IT field fasinating. I decided to know about this field more and just bought a book for Java programming. Before starting programming I quite didn't know how to express my thoughts logically and systematically. Programming not only enables me to code my thoughts but also helps me grow. I am interested in front-end now because it is where I can visualize my thoughts. For those who are reading this message, I hope that we would work together in the near future! :) If you are interested in me, check below and contact me (yoondev83@gmail.com)!",
